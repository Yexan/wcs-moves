## Short term Roadmap

- ~~add deploy on Vercel~~
- ~~add subdomainon my website for a demo URL~~
- route and component to add a move
- link the web app to firebase to use :
  - Firestorage
  - Firebase Auth
- handle the env tokens and deploy scripts for Vercel
- Publish some real moves with meaningful details

## Mid term Roadmap

- handle properly move variations links between moves
- film video for each moves
- add videos on move details

## Ideas

- ability to filter by partner starting or ending connection point
- flow recommendation after a move depending on the ending connection

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.7.
