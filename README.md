# WcsMoves

A web app to gather the West Coast Swing I already learned :)

_Note_: For now it's still a work in progress in a POC state.

## Short term Roadmap
+ add deploy on Vercel
+ add subdomainon my website for a demo URL
+ link the web app to firebase to use :
    - Firestorage
    - Firebase Auth
+ handle the env tokens and deploy scripts for Vercel
+ Publish some real moves with meaningful details


## Mid term Roadmap
+ handle properly move variations links between moves
+ film video for each moves
+ add videos on move details


## Ideas
+ ability to filter by partner starting or ending connection point
+ flow recommendation after a move depending on the ending connection


This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.7.
